# Apollo Angular Code Generation Example

Write `.graphql` files, use auto generated Angular services.

It's all possible thanks to:

- apollo-angular
- graphql-code-generator
- graphql-codegen-apollo-angular-template

## 1. Install

```bash
yarn

# or

npm install
```

## 2. Generate all

```bash
yarn graphql

# or

npm run graphql
```

## 3. Ready to go!

All documents from `src/app/graphql` were generated into services that you can find in `src/app/generated/graphql.ts`
